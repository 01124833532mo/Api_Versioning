# Api Versioning

API versioning is a practice used to manage changes in an API over time while ensuring that existing users can continue using previous versions. When APIs evolve, new features or updates are introduced, which can break compatibility with earlier versions. Versioning allows developers to provide different versions of the API so that clients can choose which version they want to interact with.
